# Stacks Foundation Critical Bounties Program

Welcome to the Stacks Foundation Critical Bounties Program repository. This program is designed to address specific ecosystem needs through targeted RFP (Request for Proposal) grants. For more information about the Critical Bounties program, other grant/bounty opportunities, and to see if there are currently any Critical Bounty RFPs accepting applications, please visit https://stacks.org/grants.

## About the Program

Critical Bounties focus on key infrastructure and tools necessary for the Stacks network's development. These bounties target high-priority areas identified by Stacks Core Engineering team members and community members, key to the development of the Stacks blockchain.

## How It Works

- RFPs are based on identified ecosystem needs (typically 2x per year)
- Proposals are evaluated by subject matter experts and Core Engineering teams
- Review process typically takes 2-3 weeks
- Awarded Critical Bounties are expected to be completed within ~6 months time
- Payments are milestone-based

## Get Involved
